It is easy. You can look at the example script if you want to find out how it works.
Don't worry. I'll add a nice Readme with version 1.0 once I upload it :-)

You can install with:
pip install easynet

Use with:
import easynet.easyclient # for Client functionality
import easynet.easyserver # for Server functionality (can handle multiple clients)
